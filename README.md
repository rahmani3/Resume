# How to host your Resume on GitHub Pages

This document is meant to give you an overall idea on how to host your own assignment of GitHub pages just like I have done. Prior to this, I had no experience in markdown or GitHub, so this is for the people who are in a similar position.

### Getting Started

First off, you will need to get a [GitHub](www.github.com) account. All you need to do is sign up for it by using your email address. Then, you will need to make a username for yourself and it can be anything you want it to be, as long as it is not taken by someone else. Once you have signed up on GitHub you can download [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com) on your computer and sign in there.

Now, before doing anything else on GitHub, we move on to making a resume. Your resume will need to be written using markdown. And to write this resume, you will need an editor. The editor I used is [Atom](https://atom.io). The main reason I used atom is because it is compatible with GitHub. Also, it has a pretty need live preview feature which allows you to see how your code is coming along, which I have found to be very helpful.

Lastly, now that you have set up both GitHub desktop and Atom on your computer, all that is left for you to do is [learn Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com). Leaning it does not take much time. You will be able to make your resume in a couple of hours. Now that you have covered all the prerequisites, you are ready to host your resume on GitHub.

 ## Creating a Repository

 Once you sign in on GitHub desktop, you will have the option of creating a repository. When you click that it will prompt you to enter a name for your repository. it can be anything you want it to be. In my case, I have named it "Resume" for obvious reasons.
